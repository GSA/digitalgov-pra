              First, you need to plan your user research! Consider your goals and whether the research will be generative (defining direction or shape of a product) or evaluative (defining improvements and opportunities). To get started, 18F offers some useful guidance for <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"

In general, qualitative user research methods that involve direct observation and non-standardized conversations will likely NOT require PRA clearance.</p>

          <p class="margin-top-05">Depending on the nature of your research activities, you may need PRA clearance. The need for PRA clearance is determined by several factors, including:</p>
          <p><span class="text-bold">Who you will collect information from:</span> whether you will have 10 or more participants (per instance of research, over a 12 month period) and whether participants are considered members of the public or not.</p>
          <p><span class="text-bold">How you will collect that information:</span> whether your research activities are "standardized" (i.e posing a set of "identical questions") and whether your research activities involve "direct observation" (i.e. "visual inspection" of participant activities).</p>

              If you do need to get PRA clearance, never fear! Qualitative user research activities at TTS will be able to go through the Fast-Track process (also known as A-11 Section 280), which generally takes 7-14 business days.
