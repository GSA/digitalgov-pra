- name: Overview of Supporting Statement: Part A Questions 
---

The Supporting Statement is a set of required questions that help provide a clear rationale for the why, what, how, who of the information collection. All Supporting Statements have a Part A, 18 questions which show compliance with the PRA and other associated laws. Collections that require statistical methods, like surveys or program evaluations, have additional requirements, called Part B. 

## What makes a good Supporting Statement?

A clear Supporting Statement will help OMB and the public better understand your collection and reduce the need for questions aimed at simply trying to understand the overall collection. Be sure to give information about the authority your agency has to collect the type of information in your proposal.

A few of the criteria covered in the Supporting Statement include: 

*	Agency purpose 
*	Need 
*	Practical utility 
*	Unnecessary duplication 

### Agency purpose
This describes the general purpose of the collection to the sponsoring agency’s goals, and how the collection will achieve a stated results. A collection may have more than one purpose; each should be described in the Supporting Statement. 

### Need
The collection must have a need for the information/data to be collected, based on a program or policy requirements. As the Federal Government, we need to help ensure we are careful when we impose burden on the public and it should be for very specific reasons. 

While “purpose” is how the collection fits with the agency goals, “need” involves how the results will help program operation or policy development. 

### Practical utility
Does the information being collected meet the stated goals? Ask yourself, is the information accurate, adequate, and reliable for the agency to use for this purpose?. Proposals should consider how an agency can use the information in ways that are reasonable, practical, workable, timely, and reliable. 

The practical utility of a collection needs to serve both the purpose and need. Requests must only collect information that’s needed for the stated purpose(s). 

A collection does not have practical utility if it cannot serve both the given purpose and need. Some reasons include:
*	Unable to process and analyze information, or provide resources to do so, within a timely manner
*	Design or method won’t achieve appropriate results
*	Collection will give unclear or non-generalizable results due to ambiguous survey questions, unduly-biased methodology, or ineffective disclosure methods.

Collections should maximize practical utility. Some examples of this include:
*	Redrawing a sample in a survey to reduce a high sample variance to produce more precise and useful data.
*	Revising the selection of a control group to make analytical comparisons more meaningful.
*	Clarifying questions to improve reliability of responses.

### Unnecessary duplication
Before collecting more information, see if there’s already accessible information that could serve the same purpose or need. This can include information collected for another purpose, such as administrative records, other federal agencies and programs, or other public and private sources. 

If existing information sources don’t have the level of detail needed to meet the purpose and need, or which can’t be meaningfully analyzed together with other collected responses, then the information gathered is necessary, not duplicative.

## Overview of Supporting Statement: Part A Questions 

Each of these 18 questions helps show the proposed collection’s compliance with the PRA. This is just an overview; we also recommend working with your agency contacts to make sure these are answered appropriately for submission in ROCIS.

1. Why is the collection necessary?
2. How and why will this information be used? Who will use it?
3. How does this collection use information technology to reduce burden?
4. What has been done to reduce duplication?
5. If the collection impacts small businesses, how is burden being minimized to them?
6. What would happen if this information wasn’t collected, or was collected less often? Are there technical or legal obstacles to reducing burden?
7. Describe any situation where the collection would:
   - Require respondents to report information more often than quarterly.
   - Require respondents to respond in fewer than 30 days after receiving it.
   - Require submission of more than an original and 2 copies of any document.
   - Require respondents to retain to retain records other than health, medical, government contract, grant-in-aid, or taxes, for more than 3 years.
   - Not produce valid, generalizable, and reliable results when used with a statistical survey.
   - Require a statistical data collection that hasn’t been approved by OMB.
   - Include a pledge of confidentiality not consistent with collection authority, not supported by data security policies, or impede the sharing with other agencies for similar confidential use.
   - Require respondents to submit trade secrets or other confidential information without processes to protect that information.
8. Provide a copy of the 60-day Federal Register notice (including publication date and page number), a summary of public comments, and information about:
   - How the agency responded to comments, specifically those about cost and hour burden
   - What efforts were made to consult with people outside the agency about data availability, collection frequency, clarity of instructions, data elements in the collection, and recordkeeping, disclosure, and reporting format
   - Regular consultation with respondents, which should happen every 3 years even if the collection activities have stayed the same; if this hasn’t happened, provide a reason why.
9. Explain any decision to provide payments or gifts to respondents, other than payment to contractors or grantees.
10. If there’s confidentiality given to respondents, how will this be ensured through statute, regulation, or agency policy?
11. Are there questions which are commonly considered private (such as sexual behavior and attitudes, and political or religious beliefs)? If so, why are they necessary, how will the information be used, and how will you explain them to respondents and gather consent.
12. Estimates of [burden hours]({{'burden' | relative_url}}).
13. Estimates of [total annual cost burden]({{'burden' | relative_url}})
14. Estimates of annualized costs to the Federal government, and a description of cost estimation methods (including quantification of hours, operational expenses, and other expenses that wouldn’t have been incurred without this collection)
15. Explanation of any program changes or adjustments in Items 13 or 14
16. If the collection will be published, how will the information be organized for publication? Will any complex analytical techniques be used?
17. If the collection won’t display the expiration date for OMB approval, explain why.
18. Explain any exceptions to the certification statement, “Certification for Paperwork Reduction Act Submissions.”
