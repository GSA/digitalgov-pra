## Plan ahead for PRA

While the PRA approval process takes at least 90 days, you don’t have to extend your project timeline by 3 months. You can start the 60-day comment period in the Federal Register and consider public comments while developing the more detailed request for OMB review.

## Process overview

1. Develop the information collection request
2. Issue 60 day federal register notice
3. Agency considers public comments and makes revisions if necessary
4. Issue 30 day federal register notice
5. Concurrent with the 30 day federal register notice, submit to OMB for review
6. OMB review

## Develop the information collection request within your agency

If [your collection needs PRA clearance]({{'do-i-need-clearance' | relative_url}}), it’s time to put together the basics of the information collection request (ICR). This first request won’t be reviewed by OMB, but it will require a Federal Register Notice for the public to review and comment on.

The Notice should include details about:

- What information is being collected
- Who you’re collecting it from
- Why you’re collecting it
- What is the estimated burden cost, i.e. the time (in hours), financial considerations, and paperwork needed for the collection
- How will the information be used once you’ve collected it

This information helps the public understand your collection during the comment period. It will be important in your writing of a strong supporting statement when requesting approval from OMB.

## Issue 60-day request for comment in the Federal Register

Since you’ll be collecting information from the public, the PRA makes sure they have time to ask questions and offer comments or ideas. Your notice needs to have enough detail for the public to consider these questions:

- Do they feel collecting this information in necessary?
- Does the burden estimate seem accurate and justified, and could it be lower?
- How will you make sure the information collected is high quality, clear, and useful?

## Consider the public comments on the notice

Reviewing comments from the public is an excellent way to understand how the people actually responding to your information collection feel about it. Review and consideration of public comments is essential and allows you to adjust and improve the request before submitting the collection to OMB for review. Part of your review involves a summary of public comments, and if you made any changes based on them.

## Issue a 30-day notice to the Federal Register

The 30-day Federal Register notice lets the public know you’ve submitted the collection to OMB and they’re reviewing it. It includes all the information from the 60 day notice and any changes you have made from public comments. If the public has further comments, they’re sent to OMB directly instead of the agency.

## Submit request to OMB for review

With your agency, you’ll submit an Information Clearance Request (ICR) for review. ICR’s are submitted to OMB through a system called ROCIS. The package submitted into ROCIS contains:

- Supporting statement (which includes the record supporting the certification), and other supporting documentation,
- The instruments of the collection (copies of the forms, surveys, recordkeeping requirements, etc.)
- A summary of any public comments, and the agency’s response(s),
- Details about the 60-day and 30-day Federal Register notices, including date, page, expected or actual publishing date, and the full text of the 30-day notice.
- A copy of the relevant statute and regulation mandating or authorizing the collection of information.
- Guides or instructions for interviewers,
- Explanatory material to be given to prospective respondents, and prepared material to be given to members of the public who do not respond.

### What makes a good supporting statement?

A clear supporting statement will help OMB and the public better understand your collection and reduce the need for questions aimed at simply trying to understand the overall collection, Be sure to give information about the authority your agency has to collect the type of information in your proposal.

The PRA approval process helps ensure the collection meets the standards of the PRA such as minimizing burden on the public and also helps to ensure it is being conducted in a way that uses appropriate methods and analysis.

## OMB review timeline and process

OMB typically reviews ICR packages within sixty days, from the submission date or the publication of the 30-day Federal Register notice (whichever is later), but can take longer in some circumstances.

During this time, your ICR package will be reviewed by an OIRA desk officer. They will look at how the collection’s supporting statement and documentation meet the standards of the PRA.
