Do you need advice on the PRA? There are a few people who may be able to help.

## Find PRA help in your agency

If you have a question about PRA, your first step should be to connect with someone in your agency with PRA expertise. Often agencies have their own requirements and processes around PRA that your collection may be subject to.

### Help planning an information request

You’ll want to make sure you’re following your agency’s best practices for collecting and managing information [when you start developing your information collection request]({{'/clearance-process/#develop-the-information-collection-request-within-your-agency'|relative_url}}). Here are some people you may want to consult with:

- **The Privacy Officer, if you’re collecting personally identifiable information (PII)**. Your privacy officer can help you determine if you are collecting PII and share agency guidance on how to properly store and use this information.

- **A statistician or program evaluation expert, if you’re using statistical methodology**. If you are using statistical methods like sampling, you’ll need to detail your approach in a Supporting Statement Part B. An agency program evaluation expert or statistician can help you plan the correct approach and write the supporting statement.

### Help submitting an information request

At larger agencies, there is often someone who is responsible for managing the agency’s PRA requests and submitting them for OIRA review through the ROCIS system. Often PRA officers are located in these offices:

- Office of the General Counsel (OGC)
- Chief Information Officer (CIO)
- Chief Data Officer (CDO)
- Regulatory Affairs / Regulatory Secretariat

Search below to find the PRA office for larger agencies.

## Connect with OIRA

The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) handles the PRA approval process. They review agency information collection requests and issue guidance on how the PRA should be interpreted and applied.

Each agency has an OIRA desk officer who reviews the agency’s information requests. You may want to contact your desk officer if:

- You are an agency PRA officer and have a question about guidance or a particular ICR
- You are at a small agency who does not have a PRA officer

OIRA is not the appropriate point of contact for PRA help if:

- Your agency has an office with PRA expertise
- You are not an agency PRA officer

To find the desk officer assigned to your agency, you can [email OIRA]({% include email.html %}).
