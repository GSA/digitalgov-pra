Many activities count as burden. These questions can help you to determine if a burden activity should be factored into your estimate. This isn’t a comprehensive list, but a starting point for you to begin thinking about the scope of burden in your collection.

## Reviewing instructions
*	How much time, effort, and cost will it take for respondents to understand what information the agency is asking for and how to collect it?

## Compiling materials necessary for collection
*	How much time, effort, and cost will it take for the respondents to locate, gather and compile necessary documentation required for the information collection?

## Technology and systems
*	What technology and systems do respondents need to gather, process, store, and send information?
*	Is this new technology that needs to be bought?
*	If it doesn’t exist at all, what’s the cost of development? Is there a cost associated with installation or with training? Are there one-time costs?
*	Is there a cost to use the technology, like a subscription?

## Adjusting existing methods
*	If a previous collection has been updated or changed, how will the current methods need to be adjusted?

## Training personnel
*	Will the collection require staff, contractors, or other agents to undergo training to respond?
*	How much time or money is needed to ensure they understand both program and policy context, and can respond to the collection?
*	Will there be additional training for actual reporting and recordkeeping methods?

## Searching data sources
*	Are there public or private data sources that respondents can use to respond to the collection?
*	What would be the cost of creating new data sources?

## Completing and reviewing collected information
*	How much time, money, and effort will it take to perform all tasks in the collection?
*	Does the information also need to be certified for accuracy and reliability?

## Sending and disclosing information
*	What must be done to send the collected information to the federal agency requesting it?
*	Does it need to be sent or disclosed to a third party, like other federal agencies or offices, state or local governments, other companies, or members of the public?
