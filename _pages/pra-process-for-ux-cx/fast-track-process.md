The fast-track process is not a type of approval that can be requested; but is a specific type of generic clearance primarily used for customer satisfaction surveys. Fast-track requests generally don’t have to undergo additional public comment, and are reviewed within five business days after submitting all materials.

Many agencies have an approved fast-track generic clearance for customer satisfaction surveys. [Check with your agency’s PRA contact]({{'/contact/' | relative_url}}) to confirm if your agency has one and to see if your collection can be submitted under the fast-track process.

## Making changes after receiving PRA clearance {#making-changes}

You _do not_ need to repeat the approval process if you are making _de minimus_ changes. ([more information](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PRA-Usability-Testing-Guidance-Memo.pdf){:target="_blank"})

These are changes that affect only the look and feel (design improvements or minor plain language edits that do not change the nature or type of information collected and do not increase burden on the public). Examples include:

- Color
- Visual layout
- Reordering instructions
- Correcting grammar or framing questions in plain language
- Fixing an address or phone number<
- Making a field or option more prominent
- Updating an icon

"Non-substantive" changes should be submitted for approval ([more information](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PRA-Usability-Testing-Guidance-Memo.pdf){:target="_blank"})

Non-substantive changes are those that do not introduce new concepts or have new intended uses for the data being collected that go beyond what was described in the original approval. **However, once you submit them, they generally get them approved within days.**

If you need to amend the instrument or number of burden hours, you must repeat the above process to get approval for the changes.

If you need to make substantive changes, work with the OMB CX Team and GSA PRA Desk to do so.
