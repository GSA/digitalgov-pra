- All [High Impact Service Providers (HISPs)](https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/){:target="_blank"} should already have the proper clearance in place because they use it for mandatory reporting.
- For non-HISPs, you can check by going to [RegInfo.gov](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRASearch){:target="_blank"} , choosing your partner agency from the drop down and searching "A-11 Section 280" in the text search field (see screenshot below).

- This is a good option if being able to go through the Fast Track process would make sense for the agency in the long term and they are willing to do so.
- Please reach out to <tts-research@gsa.gov>, the OMB CX Team, and the partner agency's PRA Desk for help initiating the process.

**If getting an umbrella Fast Track clearance in process is not an option, you can use GSA's umbrella Fast Track clearance for the duration of your engagement.**

- This will cover any research that you (as a GSA researcher) conduct.
- However, please make sure that your partner understands they will not be able to conduct the research themselves via the Fast Track process.
