title: Converting forms from paper to digital
---

Many existing, PRA-approved paper-based forms can benefit from a conversion to an interactive form, like a web-based form or an editable PDF.

As long as the approved form fields and questions are not changed and the digital materials collects the same information, OIRA would likely consider conversion to an electronic format a non-substantive change to an already approved collection, and it wouldn’t need additional public comment.

However, many agencies find that a form conversion will spark other, more substantive changes in what information is collected and how questions are written. This may [change or increase burden]({{'/burden/' | relative_url}}), or trigger questions regarding practical utility, resulting in the need for additional public comment under the PRA.
