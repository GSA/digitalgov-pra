## PRA for recruitment

Screener surveys for recruitment will need PRA clearance (if 10+ people will respond).
{:.text-header-3}

**Never fear! You can get PRA clearance for a screener in 7-14 business days.**

Simply follow the process to [get Fast Track PRA clearance]({{'/pra-process-for-ux-cx/' | relative_url}}).

- You can also [view an example](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewIC?ref_nbr=202208-3090-003&icID=257585){:target="_blank"} of a screener that got clearance.

**Please note that collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has privacy implications.**

Collecting and storing this information can be as simple as locking a folder with appropriate Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) labels, but please work with GSAIT's Privacy Office (<privacy.office@gsa.gov>) or your supporting counsel in OGC's Tech Law Division to address these implications.

## PRA for research

The following research methods do not need PRA clearance (regardless of the number of participants).
{:.text-header-3}

Each of these methods involve direct observation of participants (in-person, virtual, or on a recording) and/or use open-ended questioning, making them exempt from needing PRA clearance regardless of the number of participants.

Close-ended UX/CX feedback surveys _will need_ PRA clearance and _are eligible_ for the Fast Track process.
{:.text-header-3}

**Quantitative feedback surveys**
{:.text-base-dark}

This could include, for example, feedback surveys that are based on a Likert scale and/or any other questioning that will produce numerical data for analysis.

- Example: [IRS Direct File post submission survey](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewIC?ref_nbr=202208-3090-003&icID=264606){:target="_blank"}

**Close-ended, qualitative feedback surveys**
{:.text-base-dark}

This could include surveys that ask a set of identically worded questions with close-ended responses to participants.

- Example: [USWDS top tasks research study](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewIC?ref_nbr=202203-3090-003&icID=258408){:target="_blank"}

Larger-scale surveys are not eligible for the Fast Track process.
{:.text-header-3}

**Any larger-scale research that implies statistical rigor or relates to the development of surveys, program effectiveness metrics, or outcome measures and program-level decision-making.**
{:.text-base-dark}

This kind of research will need PRA clearance, but will not be covered by the Fast Track process.

- Example: [GSA equity study on remote identity proofing](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202401-3090-004){:target="_blank"}

Please contact <GSARegSec@gsa.gov> and consult [pra.digital.gov](https://pra.digital.gov/){:target="_blank"} for more information.
