Not every request or collection falls under the PRA’s scope, and you may not need clearance at all. When figuring out if PRA clearance is needed, consider the following:

- What type of information are you collecting
- Who are you collecting it from
- How will you be collecting it, and
- Why are you collecting this information

This is just a starting point to see if your collection needs PRA clearance. We encourage [getting in touch with your agency's PRA contact]({{'/contact/' | relative_url}}) to answer more in-depth questions.

### What type of information are you collecting?

The type of information you’re collecting will help determine if you need PRA clearance.

#### Needs PRA clearance:

Asking for information to be sent to the government, including:

- Forms, such as the IRS 1040
- Written reports, such as grantee performance reports
- Surveys, such as customer satisfaction or behavioral surveys
- Recordkeeping requirements, such as OSHA requirements that employers keep records of workplace accidents.
- Third-party or public disclosures, such as nutrition labeling requirements for food.
- Program evaluations
- Research studies, focus groups and customer satisfaction surveys,
- Applications for benefits and grant programs

#### Doesn’t need PRA clearance

- Direct observation, such as watching how long it takes a person to complete a transaction, or how someone uses a new website to find answers.
- General requests for public input and comments, such as a “Tell Us About Your Experience” sheet with open-ended space for someone to respond.
- Voluntary commercial transactions such as information necessary and solely used for payment and delivery of an item.
- Information asked for or received in connection to a public hearing or meeting.

#### Information at public meetings and online

The discussion and conversation that takes place at a public meeting has long been exempt from the PRA and using online interactive meeting tools such as public conferences calls, webinars, discussions board and forums, and chat sessions are considered the online equivalent of in-person public meetings and do not need PRA clearance.

Some information collections are generally not subject to the PRA, including: federal investigations and civil actions, antitrust actions, and intelligence activities.

### Who are you collecting information from?

#### Members of the public

Generally, this means people or groups outside of the federal government. Some groups that are considered members of the public include:

- Individual people (including federal contractors)
- Businesses and associations
- State, tribal, and local governments

If you’re only collecting information from federal employees or military personnel as part of their job, then you don’t need PRA clearance. If the information isn’t part of their work-related duties, you will need PRA clearance.

#### Voluntary or Mandatory Collection

Regardless if your collection is voluntary, (i.e. the public is not required by law to provide information), or mandatory, the Paperwork Reduction Act treats the collections the same.

#### Ten or more people or groups

Over a 12-month period, if you are requesting the same information from ten or more people or entities, you need PRA clearance.

If you’re requesting information from fewer than ten people or groups, but they represent the majority or all of an industry or sector, you will need PRA clearance.
